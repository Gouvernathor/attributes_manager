# renpy-AttributesManager
A framework to help handling layeredimage attributes (and image attributes in general, really, it's not at all specific to layeredimages) in Ren'Py.

The `attributes_manager.rpy` file contains the code itself.
It contains classes whose exact features are documented in their docstrings.

The `script.rpy` files contains an example as to how to use it with the assets of the `images/` folder,
as well as a comparison with how the same thing would be done vanilla-style.

## Terms of use
Use it freely in any project, just drop my name in the credits, and add a link to this repo if you liked it ðŸ¥°
